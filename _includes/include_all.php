To,
  Future Self or anyone trying to debug this
  first off all I AM SORRY
  now comes explanation ,The below files are filled with complex queries and algo's
  when I was writting them I and god knew what it was,
  now only god knows..
  and to my utter surprise some of them actually works at least I think they do.
  and at last I again humbly apologies for this sin of mine .

 	If you are still brave enough to debug it you have all my best wishes,
  just do me a favor and increment the below value after you are done.

  TOTAL_HOURS_WASTED = 8
